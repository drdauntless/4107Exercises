Exercise1:

For exercise 1 there is a helper function that is designed to take in the value desired, in this case 500, and pass it to the method that does the calculations. Also within the helper function the bill denominations are set in a list named bills. The method that completes the calculation is a recursive function. It essentially splits the problem in half one case where the first denomination is taken and one where that value is skipped. It then adds those together for the final return value.

Exercise2:

To solve this problem a for loop is used to populate a dictionary for each person with probability that a value will occur. Then another for loop is used to calculate the probabilities of certain events occurring. Those probabilities are then summed and this is the probability gregor winning

Exercise 3:

I highly recommend not running the bigger 2d array included in this file, you will be waiting for a long time. This approach is more brute force. Essentially, the algorithm goes through all possible combinations of the board looking for the correct values. Then those are summed and returned.
